# Yashika
An AI mental health chatbot

Sometimes it’s hard to open up to people. Especially when you’re in a college meeting new people, going to new places, new environments it gets hard at times. Most people just bottle up their feeling and close it up in their hearts until they’re stress worries and tensions keep building up. 

I personally did have a lot of stress and worries. It wasn’t until I met a special someone that I could talk to and be myself around that I started to be more open and more happy around my circumstances. 

This may not be the case for everyone and many people would not be having a person or figure in their life like that at the moment.
For that reason I present Yashika, an AI mental health chatbot, for whatever worries you might have, advice, a friend to talk to, just as I had found my special someone to talk to and comfort me I hope she can help you until you too find that special someone 
one day.


PS: To whomsoever it may concern,

You are the best thing that had happened to me and I would never wish for a moment other than what we have now. I love you and I don’t know what I’d be without you. Thank you for standing by with me all this time and I hope you will be for many more years to come.
